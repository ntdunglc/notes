# Chapter 1: Helping children deal with their feelings
You need to understand/empathize their feelings before having any action  
Howtos:
- Listen with full attention
- Acknowledge their feelings with a word - "Oh" "Mmm" "I see"  
Don't question much
- Give their feelings a name - "frustrating" "disappointed"  
Don't repeat their words
- Give them their wishes in fantasy - "I wish I could have the banana ripe for you right now"
# Chapter 2: Engaging Cooperation
Howtos:
- Describe what you see or describe a problem - "there's a wet towel on the bed"
- Give information - "Milk turn sour when it isn't refrigerated"
- Say it with a word - "the light!"
- Describe what you feel - "I feel frustrated when I says something and can't finish!"
- Write a note - note as "Shhh! Mom and Dad are sleeping"

Sometimes you need to get acknowledged for what you said

# Chapter 3: Alternatives to punishment
I feel this is the most difficult to master
Howtos:
- Express your strong disapproval, without attacking character - "I'm furious that my new saw was left outside to rust in the rain!"
- Point out a way to be helpful
- State your expectation - "I expect the toys to be cleaned up after playing"
- Show the child how to make amend (fix it) - 
- Offer a choice - "No running in the supermarket. You can walk or you can sit in the cart. You decide"
- Take action, show the consequence of their misbehavior - "the toolbox is locked because .. ""  
It's different from punishment that the consequence is the natural result of the behavior, punishment is often unrelated, ie "slap in hand"
- Problem-solve, brainstorm with the kids how to improve

# Chapter 4: Encouraging autonomy
Howtos:
- Let the child make choices - "Do you want half a glass of juice or a whole?"
- Show respect for the a child's struggle - "Tying shoes need a lot of fancy finger work"
- Don't ask too many questions - "Glad to see you, welcome home"
- Don't rush to answer questions: - "That's an interesting question, what do you think?"
- Encourage the children to use source outside of the house
- Don't take away hope - "So you are thinking of trying out for the play! That should be an experience"

# Chapter 5: Praise
Don's use "automatic" word like "great" , "awesome"
Howtos:
- Describe what you see - "I see a lean floor, a smooth bed, and books neatly lined up on the shelf"
- Describe what you feel - "It's a pleasure to walk into this room"
- Sum up the child's praiseworthy behavior in a word - "You stood up for your friend even other kids make fun of him, that's friendship/loyalty/courage"

# Chapter 6: Freeing children from playing role
Howtos:
- Look for opportunities to show the child a picture of themself - "You've had that toy since you were three and it almost looks like new"
- Put children in situations where they can see themselves differently - "Could you take the screwdriver and tighten the pulls on these drawers"
- Let children overhear you say something positive about them - "he held arm steady even though the shot hurt"
- Model the behavior you want to see, teach by example
- Be a storehouse for child's special moment - "I remember the time you acted bravely when you saw the fire"
- When your child acts according to the old label, state your feelings and/or your expectations - "I don't like that. Despite your strong feelings, I expect sportsmanship from you"

# Chapter 7: Putting it together
You use multiple techniques at the same time
