*Not great idea*

Build a shared calendar and notes to organize your daily life. Add functionality to add events and reminder. Have APIs.
Organize calendar, notes and potentially more plugins in dashboards.

## User stories
- [] user can create calendar or notes. Call them with a name (for now: ITEM)
- [] user can share their ITEM with other users (read or write), or make it public (read only).
- [] user can organize their ITEMs in dashboards. For eg: family dashboard, school dashboard, sport events dashboard
- [] user can save dashboard to favorite list.
- [] user can edit ITEMs in dashboard and other users will see it in REALTIME.  

## Bonus feature
- [] user can build customizable ITEM with UI element and backend API to populate data.
    - Todo list, survey, RSS
- [] can we integrate with other APIs? For eg, create a UI element for Twitter, or Feedly
    - I doubt so but will check

## Techonologies
- Use Elixir and Phoenix to build
