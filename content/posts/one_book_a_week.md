Learning how to speed read.

I started with technical books, covering the topics that I'm more curious about. The list of books I've read recently

### Good Code, Bad Code
Author: Tom Long

A decent book, introduce some best practices of coding, suitable for more junior developers, but senior can also benefit from it

### Data-Oriented Programming_ Unlearning Objects, Version 2 
Author: Yehonathan Sharvit

Okay book, the book tie to the approach used by Clojure like immutability, build different structure for data and code. Not clear how to apply in real world project using database or other web service.

### Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns
Author: Mark Seemann, Steven van Deursen

Decent book about Dependency Injection and how to use it in .NET, a good read for OOP developers.

###  Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming
Author: Brian Lonsdorf

A good introduction of functional programming, and using JS make it easier to digest.

### Type-Driven Development with Idris
I'm interested in Type-driven development, but don't like the language syntax, so gave up after first 2 chapters.

### Domain Modeling Made Functional - Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#
by Scott Wlaschin

A very good book that give introduction to both Functional programming and Domain driven design. The book teach how to get requirements from domain experts, use type system to capture requirements, and compose functions with dependencies.

### Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time
This took few weeks actually. A decent book about software practice a google, from process of code review, testing, style guide to google tooling like code search, monorepo, build system and CI/CD. Especially helpful if you are joining google >.<

### The Pragmatic Programmer
