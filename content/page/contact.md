## Hi I'm Dung Tri Nguyen
#### a girl dad, a non-stop reader and learner
As a developer, I'm still trying to figure out the domain of software that I would stay.  
I started a web developer, spent few years as a data engineer, and recently I'm interested in building
high performance systems. 

More importantly, I'm the dad of my two girls, and love to spend my best energy with them.

*The notes here are more for myself to organize my thoughts and experiences, not the best way to do any software development task. It just reflects my experience.*
