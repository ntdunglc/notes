      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Dung Tri Nguyen a girl dad, a non-stop reader and learner As a developer, I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to figure out the domain of software that I would stay.
I started a web developer, spent few years as a data engineer, and recently I&amp;rsquo;m interested in building high performance systems.
More importantly, I&amp;rsquo;m the dad of my two girls, and love to spend my best energy with them.

      <description>This note summarize recent experience building a few command line (CLI) applications in Python.
Here are a few assumptions before I describe the approach
 It&amp;rsquo;s not a CLI that process GBs of data, or need to have lowest overhead. If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, Rust/Go might be better candidate than Python. It&amp;rsquo;s not an interactive CLI like mysql. However it can still support simple interactive workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s not a CLI that do one thing and do it well.</description>
